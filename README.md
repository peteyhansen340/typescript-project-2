# Overview

I wrote this project to learn how to create a user authentication system using TypeScript. It includes features like user registration, login, and profile management. This project is a great way to practice TypeScript concepts and build a real-world application.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
Register and store multiple users.
Login functionality with credential checks.
Manage users in a list (like a database simulation).
Asynchronous operations to simulate real-world delays.
Terminal output to interact with users.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
This project is a simple user authentication system built using TypeScript. It includes functionality for user registration, login, and profile management. Weâ€™ll be using TypeScript features like classes, asynchronous functions, and lists to achieve this
